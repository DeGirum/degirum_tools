Result Analyzer Base Module Overview
====================================

This module provides a base class (`ResultAnalyzerBase`) for performing custom post-processing and
image annotation on DeGirum PySDK inference results. These analyzers can be used with
compound models, streaming gizmos, and regular models to add advanced data processing and annotation steps
to inference pipelines.

Key Concepts
------------

- **Analysis**:
  By overriding the `analyze()` method, child classes can read and augment the `InferenceResults`
  (e.g., by adding extra keys to the internal `results` list).

- **Annotation**:
  By overriding the `annotate()` method, child classes can draw additional overlays on the
  original input image (e.g., bounding boxes, text labels, or any custom markings).

- **Integration**:
  Analyzers can be attached to a model or a compound model via the `attach_analyzers()` method,
  so their analysis and annotation is automatically applied to each inference result.

Typical Usage Example
---------------------

1. Create a custom analyzer subclass:
   ```python
   from degirum_tools.result_analyzer_base import ResultAnalyzerBase

   class MyCustomAnalyzer(ResultAnalyzerBase):
       def analyze(self, result):
           # E.g., add custom fields to each detection
           for r in result.results:
               r["custom_info"] = "my_data"

       def annotate(self, result, image):
           # E.g., draw text or bounding boxes on the image
           # Return the annotated image
           return image
   ```
2. Attach it to a model or compound model:
   ```python
   model.attach_analyzers(MyCustomAnalyzer())
   ```
3. Run inference. Each `InferenceResults` object will be passed through your analyzer, optionally
   modifying the result data and providing a new overlay.

class ResultAnalyzerBase(ABC):
    """
    Base class for result analyzers which can modify or extend the content of inference results
    and optionally annotate images with new data.

    Subclasses should override:
      - `analyze(result)`: to augment or inspect the inference result.
      - `annotate(result, image)`: to draw additional overlays or text onto the provided image.

    @abstractmethod
    def analyze(self, result):
        """
        Analyze and optionally modify a DeGirum PySDK inference result.

        This method should access and potentially modify `result.results` (the list of detections,
        classifications, or similar structures) to add any custom fields. These modifications
        will then appear in downstream processes or when the result is displayed/serialized.

        Args:
            result (degirum.postprocessor.InferenceResults):
                The inference result object to analyze. Subclasses can read and/or modify
                the internal `results` list or other properties.

    def annotate(self, result, image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Annotate an image with additional data derived from the analysis step.

        Called after `analyze()` has been invoked on `result`. This method is typically used to
        draw bounding boxes, text, or other graphical elements representing the analysis data.

        Args:
            result (degirum.postprocessor.InferenceResults):

        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray:
                The annotated image. By default, this base implementation returns the image
                unchanged. Subclasses should override to perform custom drawing.

        By default, this does nothing.
